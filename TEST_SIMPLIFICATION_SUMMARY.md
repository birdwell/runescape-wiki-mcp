# Test Simplification Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Removed Unnecessary Test Runner Files
- Deleted `test-runner.mjs` - redundant, use `npm test` directly
- Deleted `test-server.js` - manual test replaced with proper integration tests  
- Deleted `test-simple.js` - duplicated npm test functionality

### 2. Simplified Test Utilities
- Removed complex Jest mocking utilities
- Kept only simple mock data and basic validation helpers
- Reduced `testUtils.ts` from 225 lines to ~50 lines

### 3. Simplified All Test Files
- **itemTools.test.ts**: Reduced from 338 to ~120 lines using nock for HTTP mocking
- **priceTools.test.ts**: Reduced from 217 to ~100 lines
- **playerTools.test.ts**: Reduced from 376 to ~90 lines  
- **server.test.ts**: Reduced from 345 to ~100 lines, focused on basic functionality
- **resources.test.ts**: Reduced from 411 to ~80 lines
- **errorHandling.test.ts**: Reduced from 491 to ~115 lines
- **integration.test.ts**: Reduced from 174 to ~110 lines

### 4. Used Better Testing Libraries
- Added `nock` for simpler HTTP mocking instead of complex Jest mocks
- Nock provides clean API interception without manual mock functions

### 5. Key Improvements
- Tests are now much more readable and maintainable
- Removed excessive mocking and edge cases
- Focused on testing actual functionality, not implementation details
- Eliminated redundant test scenarios
- Tests now run faster and are easier to debug

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/itemTools.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## Test Structure

Each test file now follows a simple pattern:
1. Import nock for HTTP mocking
2. Set up/tear down nock in beforeEach/afterAll
3. Test the happy path scenarios
4. Test basic error cases
5. No excessive edge case testing

The tests are now focused on verifying that:
- Tools handle their parameters correctly
- API responses are processed properly
- Errors are handled gracefully
- The MCP server structure is correct
